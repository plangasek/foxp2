Three data sets used in” Common Genetic Variants in FOXP2 Are Not Associated with Individual Differences in Language Development.”  The discovery data set was comprised of 834 children who were members of a Longitudinal sample and children who were members of a School sample.  Both samples are contained in the Iowa data set.  The Iowa data set contains a quantitative variable LCOMP that represents a composite z-score representing oral language ability.  The data set also identifies which sample the children belonged to and the allele calls for 13 tag SNPs located across FOXP2.  A second data file, ELVS, contains data from a separate sample of children who were used to test for replication of inconsistent evidence of an association between language and the SNP rs1916988.  The ELVS file provides a composite oral language score scaled in standard score units (mean=100, SD=15) and the genotype calls for the  SNP rs1916988.
